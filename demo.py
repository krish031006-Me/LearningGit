There is a staging area in between you and the github repo you are commiting to 
This staging area is knows as index or cache
we use git add file1 command to add the file 1 to staging area and then commit the changes using git commit
Keep in minf git add isn't only used to add a file into the staging area but it adds the current state the file is in it'll
delete the file from staging area if it was deleted from the main working directory.
You can also skip the staging area and commite directly

# git commit -m "Some msg for later review" this is used to commit to git and -m here means msg which we add in inverted commas
# you can type git commit without -m for gitbash to open a file and there you can add a descriptive msg under 80 characters i guess
# git ls-files is the command used to get the files currently present in the staging area  
# git mv file1.js fiel2.js is the way to make git track all moving file and renaming the file
# echo logs/>.gitignore it ignores the content inside log folder for git
# you can write code .gitignore to open the gitignore folder in vs code and add our files in it 
# if a file was first commited and then added to gitignore then git will keep tracking them so we use git --cached -r file_name to remove them from staging area
# git ls-files show all the files present in our staging area 
# git status -s provides a short comprehension to the status of the current repo
